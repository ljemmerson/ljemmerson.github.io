				<p class="dark_text">Partner Edition is a product for Accountants that lets them manage large groups of clients from one central location. I was the Lead Designer on this project, working on the research, interaction and visual design. Throughout, I tapped into the insight of my colleagues and this is a culmination of a large piece of collaboration.</p>

				<h4 class="dark_text">The Challenge</h4>
				<div class="dark_key_line"></div>
				<p class="dark_text">The previous version of partner edition was very dated with its Skeuomorphic visuals and limited features; initially it only allowed users to access different clients and leave notes on them. My task was to see how this product could be built upon and influence the future roadmap, helping to create an app packed full of useful features for Accountants.</p>

					<div class="light_key_line"></div>
					<p class="light_text">Enlisting the help of another designer, we both Guerrilla tested the prototype at a popular accounting conference. Depending on the interests of participants, we flexed the questions that we asked and noted down any key themes.</p>
					<p class="light_text">After the conference, I further iterated the prototype so that our User Researcher could do some more formative research later. Facilitating some sessions myself, we then gathered feedback and I iterated the designs again until we had our final MVP deliverables.</p>

				<h4 class="dark_text">Full-screen Dialog</h4>
				<div class="dark_key_line"></div>
				<p class="dark_text">Using the final visuals as a schematic, we started to implement the new components in React. The first of which was a new full-screen dialog that significantly reduced the number of clicks for importing large numbers of clients in one go. It was also used for the subscriptions dialog so that users could batch apply subscriptions to the same clients after they had been imported.</p>

				<h4 class="dark_text">Sidebar</h4>
				<div class="dark_key_line"></div>
				<p class="dark_text">Reducing the amount of time spent in Partner Edition was a key theme across our new components and the product owner prioritised features that achieved this accordingly. For example, previously users would have to go to a separate page to get an overview of their client’s status. With the implementation of a new sidebar, users now have just one click before they can see a list of relevant KPIs and reports per client.</p>

				<h4 class="dark_text">The Outcome</h4>
				<div class="dark_key_line"></div>
				<p class="dark_text">We released an MVP that introduced some simple but highly sought after patterns that were prioritised by the insight gathered from our research. Consequently, Sage now has a much faster product that feels visually consistent with the rest of our other apps. Partner Edition has now also become more of a client management system rather than just a simple list of subscription links.</p>

Being a chartered accountant myself, I hope you will all appreciate what a difference this product will make to our partners and accountants.’</p>

					<p class="quoted_text">‘I gave a demonstration of Partner Edition to Jim Scott (Global VP of Partner Programme) and his full team. It was very (very) well received and the team saw huge potential of where they would use this with partners that they have in the pipeline.’</p>

					<p class="quoted_text long_quote_padding">'Luke has given 100% of his available time and attention to this project, at several times going way above and beyond expectations.</p>
					<p class="quoted_text long_quote_padding">He's produced some fantastic designs which have really helped bring the project to life - these designs have been used by the development teams directly, by the UX team for user feedback, and I've used them extensively to aid with explaining the project to Sage stakeholders around the business. They have been key to all my stakeholder updates so far - and people are really excited by them! Amazing work that I hope we are able to bring fully to life in the product.</p>
					<p class="quoted_text">Luke is really efficient, and has great intuition. I'm assuming he has very little experience working on 'accountant' products but you wouldn't know it - he takes very little time at all to understand a task that's been assigned to him and to run with it and produce fantastic concepts to support it. He also requests regular feedback and keeps me fully up to date with what he's working on, which I really appreciate.'.</p>

			<div class="right_wrapper right_baseline_alignment">
				<p class="dark_text quote_spacer">The new time-saving components are now beginning to filter into Sage’s other products. As well as this, the prototype that I tested has also influenced the Partner Edition Roadmap, meaning that any features that didn’t make it into the MVP will be built in the coming months. These include alerts, improved notes and client-to-user messaging.</p>
